<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Precis ontology is designed to encapsulate portfolio information about an individual. This includes information that would traditionally be presented in a Resume/CV. This ontology is designed to be used with the Precis toolkit; see http://precis.rukmal.me for more.

Currently, this ontology powers a templating engine to generate dyanmic resumes, but has the potential to power other personal data driven experiences.</span>
