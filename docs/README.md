## Overview

Precis is first and foremost an [Ontology for modeling personal professional metadata](https://precis.rukmal.me/ontology). That is, it provides functionality to track metadata such as Degerees, Courses, Portfolio Items (Publications, Projects, Talks), Work Experience, etc.

In addition to the Precis Ontology modeling personal metadata, the Precis toolkit extends this Ontology by providing additional functionality, specifically:

- JSON Loading tool, to ingest data into the Precis Ontology (outputs RDF)
- Simple Pythonic Query API for information stored in the Ontology
- Extensible templating engine (for CV/Resume generation), built with [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/)

Each of these functions are illustrated below in the Quickstart Guide.


This folder contains advanced documentation for specific topics in Precis.

Note that the content of this documentation is not necessary to use the Precis toolkit. Return to the main [`README.md`](../README.md) for Quick Start instructions to get started.


## Advanced Documentation

### Template Engine

- [Template Instance Configuration Files](template_engine/configuration_files.md)

A description of the underlying Precis ontology. Details each of the individual concepts, object properties and data properties comprising the ontology.

### Archive

**Note**: This is mostly out of date, but the broad strokes are accurate. Preserved for posterity.
