From original README (needs to be incorporated)


## General Notes (To be expanded on)

- The instances ingested by the loader will be in a different namespace than the original ontology (provide override option, but default will be `rukmal.me` based).

- Need to talk about how the ontology version is frozen (i.e. getting it from releases, and not the repo)
